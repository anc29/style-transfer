Topics in Computer Science Semester 2 2021: Evaluation of ML Models for Artistic Style Transfer

This project aims to explore two different ML models for artistic style transfer, which is the process of transferring the style of an impressionist artwork onto a photograph. The models to be explored are Cycle-GAN and Neural Style Transfer. Existing implementations of these models (Github links and papers below) will be used and various parameters will be tuned to help with comparing the two models and finding an optimal implementation.

My implementations are based on the following papers and TensorFlow implementations.
